# docker-compose.yaml

Its just awesome it helps us bind multiple images into one.

The best part is unlike the way we need to build the image  
using the `docker build -f dockerfile -t tagname .`  

We can choose to simply write all the configurations and just do  
`docker-compose up` and `docker-compose down`   

It takes care of the rest. So elegant and classy.
